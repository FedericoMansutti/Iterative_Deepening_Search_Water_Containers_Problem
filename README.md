# Uniform_Cost_Search_Water_Containers
 
There are three containers of maximum capacity 12, 8 and 3 respectively.
Given an initial water level in each of the three containers, and a goal of having X liters in one of the containers,
the algorithm finds the shortest path to achieving the goal.
The algorithm is complete and optimal.

Allowed actions: filling the container to maximum capacity, pouring the water from one container to another, emptying one container.
